This is a project I found on github that had no license. I took the questions the original poster had and modified them to get the most out of the project. All of the code is original and written by me.

The project is essentially just a series of questions a business would likely ask based on data they collected, where you need to modify the table containing the data and view it in different ways to answer the questions.
